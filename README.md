# scaleway lambda shell

### Simple Lambda wrapper written in PHP (It's easy to edit), and Launch Shell Scripts (ShellScriptLambda)

This is a simple, PHP, Lambda Wrapper that I used to run shell script as a lambda function on the scaleway.

I didn't realize the scaleway does not include **Bash** or **JQ** in their PHP Lambda container, so I included
that and then everything worked.

Scaleway was Very easy to use and configure.
